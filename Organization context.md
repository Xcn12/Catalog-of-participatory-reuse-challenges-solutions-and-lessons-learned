### Participatory Reuse Summary in Identified Cases

| Case name | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| Apache | When the main developer of the popular NCSA Web server (HTTPd) became unavailable, developers from Apache, who were users of HTTPd, began exchanging fixes and improvements and started collaborating through a mailing list. |
| Lucent Technologies, Inc. (Lucent) | Lucent's application domain is telecommunication software. The designated developers develop the shared reusable asset (a Session Initiation Protocol server), which evolved to a common platform. Everyone in the organization can use and contribute to it under the guidance of an internal steering group. A central code repository stores the shared reusable asset and is accessible to everyone within the organization. |
| Nokia | Nokia's application domain is mobile communication. Nokia has an internal software forge named iSource to host the reusable assets from business units and platform programs. A steering group, which consists of the core developers from different business groups, decides on the development content. |
| Hewlett-Packard (HP) | HP achieved different levels of participatory reuse through three programs: Owen project, Corporate Source (CS), and Collaborative Development Program (CDP). The Owen project utilizes the Sirius framework for firmware reuse within one division. CS advocates that all groups inside HP should make their source code available to enable participatory reuse between printer groups and operating system groups. CDP extends participatory reuse further to third parties and other foundational features. This summary focuses only on participatory reuse within the organization. |
| IBM | IBM had two programs for participatory reuse: Community Source (CMS) and IBM Internal Open Source Bazaar (IIOSB). To participate in CMS, managerial approval was required to share confidential reusable assets with developers who were not directly involved. IIOSB allowed developers to share reusable assets organization-wide without managerial approval. |
| Philips Healthcare | Philips Healthcare's application domain is medical systems. Participatory reuse was applied to improve its product line platform for image processing and handling. Consumers could change reusable assets according to their needs. Once updated, ownership and maintenance were transferred to the consumers who made the changes. If the platform team deemed the changes beneficial to others, they could accept them and resume ownership and maintenance responsibilities. |
| Philips Research | Philips Research's application domain is video processing. Participatory reuse was applied to the Philips File Standard for Pictorial Data (PFSPD) project, used to store video sequences. A core team was responsible for developing and maintaining reusable components, while consumers also contributed to development and maintenance. |
| GlobalSoft (or SoftCom) | GlobalSoft's application domain is safety-critical systems. Participatory reuse was applied to improve its software product line platform. A core team developed and released shared reusable assets that evolved into a common platform. Different business units used these assets to build products, following a collaborative development strategy. |
| Ericsson | Ericsson's application domain is telecommunication software. Participatory reuse was achieved through the Ericsson Network Management System (ENM) and the Application Development Platform (ADP ecosystem). A small unit called Community Developed Software was created in ENM. Central teams developed shared reusable infrastructure assets, evolving from a common platform to microservices, with anchor teams facilitating collaboration between producers and consumers. |
| Google | Google's application domain is online services. All developers act as both producers and consumers of reusable assets, such as design patterns. Ownership remains with the producers or current implementers. Designated producers provide central libraries and components, ensure scope and quality, and assist consumers with upgrades. Development infrastructure and source code repositories are centralized and accessible organization-wide. |
| PayPal | PayPal's application domain is financial services. Participatory reuse was applied to develop a digital platform consisting of a repository of reusable digital components available for internal and external projects. |
| Europace AG | Europace AG's application domain is financial services. Participatory reuse was applied with the goal of shifting responsibilities to personnel with the most expertise. Trusted committer roles were introduced to motivate contributors. Reusable assets (microservices) and their documentation were stored in a GitHub repository to support cross-unit collaboration. |
| Siemens Healthcare Private Ltd. (Siemens) | Siemens' application domain is medical systems. A platform team implemented common reusable functionalities, while business teams developed variable functions. Participatory reuse occurred when business teams contributed features to the platform with design and code approval from the platform team. |
| Zalando | Zalando's application domain is digital fashion systems. Participatory reuse was applied to develop a digital common platform for internal projects. Due to sensitivity to cultural change, relatively formal governance was introduced early. APIs were used to extend reusable infrastructure components across the organization instead of opening large volumes of microservices too early. |
| S-Group Solutions | S-Group Solutions' application domain is spatial and geographical information systems. Developers acted as both producers and consumers. Reusable assets, mainly npm packages and some microservices, were stored in a DevOps repository and were transparent to everyone in the organization. Consumers could contribute new functionalities or bug fixes in coordination with code owners, following contribution guidelines. |
