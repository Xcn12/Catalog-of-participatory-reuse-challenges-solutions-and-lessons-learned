# Catalog-of-participatory-reuse-challenges-solutions-and-lessons-learned
Definition of participatory reuse: an InnerSource practice where consumers of the reusable assets also contribute to their development and maintenance.<br> 

Organizations, such as Ericsson, Philips Healthcare, and Lucent, are increasingly adopting Participatory Reuse. Organizations also shared their participatory reuse experiences in literature, such as the challenges they face, solutions they implemented or suggested, and the lessons learned from the participatory reuse implementation. We conducted a case survey to organize this knowledge in the form of a catalog. This catalog aims to help practitioners understand the challenges they face during the participatory reuse process and to identify the solutions and lessons learned from real-world adoption. 	<br> 

The file table.md provides a preview of the catalog, while the file Catalog.html includes a filter function to help users find the right information more quickly.

## The themes of this catalog
There are three themes for participatory reuse challenges, solutions, and lessons learned: **developing reusable assets, using reusable assets, and managing participatory reuse**. <br> 
The first two themes—developing and using reusable assets—are derived from the "development for and with reuse" concept, while managing participatory reuse covers the remaining aspects.

## The areas under each theme

## The structure of this catalog  
The catalog has nine columns.<br>
Column 1: A. Participatory reuse themes	<br>
Column 2: B. Participatory reuse areas	<br>
Column 3: C. Participatory reuse challenges	<br>
Column 4: D. Case organizations (challenges)	<br>
Column 5: E. Case organizations references (challenges)	<br>
Column 6: F. Participatory reuse solutions and lessons learned	<br>
Column 7: G. Case organizations (solutions and lessons learned)	<br>
Column 8: H. Case organizations references (solutions and lessons learned)	<br>
Column 9: I. Mapped InnerSource patterns from InnerSource Commons

## InnerSource patterns
The InnerSource pattern in Column 9 originates from [InnerSource Common](https://innersourcecommons.org/). You can access the patterns via [InnerSource Pattern](https://patterns.innersourcecommons.org/).
