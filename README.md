Column 1: A. Participatory reuse themes	<br>
Column 2: B. Participatory reuse areas	<br>
Column 3: C. Participatory reuse challenges	<br>
Column 4: D. Case organizations (challenges)	<br>
Column 5: E. Case organizations references (challenges)	<br>
Column 6: F. Participatory reuse solutions and lessons learned	<br>
Column 7: G. Case organizations (solutions and lessons learned)	<br>
Column 8: H. Case organizations references (solutions and lessons learned)	<br>
Column 9: I. Mapped InnerSource patterns from InnerSource Commons		

The file Catalog.md provides a preview of the catalog, while the file Catalog.html includes a filter function to help users find the right information more quickly.

## The themes of this catalog
There are three themes for participatory reuse challenges, solutions, and lessons learned: developing reusable assets, using reusable assets, and managing reusable assets. <br> 
The first two themes—developing and using reusable assets—are derived from the 'development for and with reuse' concept, while managing reusable assets covers the remaining aspects.
